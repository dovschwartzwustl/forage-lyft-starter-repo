#must import these classes to use their functionalities

#each method takes in the necessary variables and..
#passes them into either the Engine or the Battery fields...
#to make the necessary batteries or engines...
#the car is then composed of those batteries/engines and returned

#this factory method makes it easy to add new cars to the fleet
#would also not be that hard to add different components such as tires
